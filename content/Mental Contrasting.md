Based on a study by Gabriele Oettingen.  

"Fantasy realization theory states that when people contrast their fantasies about a desired
future with reflections on present reality, a necessity to act is induced that leads to the
activation and use of relevant expectations."

## Key ideas
-   If you contrast where you are and where you want to be, that is more likely to drive energy
    towards your goals.
-   **Make reality appear as an obstacle to fantasy realization.**

## In practice
-   Imagine the future end state or goal.
-   Figure out where you are right now **AND** the obstacles that might stand in your way.
-   Then probably pair this with [[Implementation Intentions]] for a powerful technique to increase
    motivation and discipline.
