Welcome to my [[Digital Gardens|digital garden]] - I'm Diwash. I have been exploring personal knowledge management for a long time and this site is my experiment with doing so in a more public manner that aligns with the idea of [[Work with the garage door up]].  

You will mainly find notes about software engineering and productivity, however I am just getting started and plan on talking more about AI, PKM systems, mental models and many more.  

The notes are laid out in a [[Networked Thinking|network]] which may be confusing at first, but should allow for easy exploration. For now feel free to use the graph below to dive right in or the map of contents to choose a topic.
