Study by [[Angela Duckworth]] that paired [[Mental Contrasting]] with implementation intentions.

-   High school students who were going to take an exam.
-   Asked all the students to visualise succeeding and doing well in the exam.
-   First(control) group: Tasked to write an essay about an influential person in their life.
-   Second(treatment) group: Tasked to envision exam obstacles and craft 'if-then' plans to succeed.
-   Result: Treatment group completed 60% ==more practice== questions than the control group.

## Key ideas
-   Implementation intentions can allow you to put more practice in.
-   Pair with mental contrasting for a very well validated and evidence based method to increase
    motivation and discipline.

## In practice
-   Pair with mental contrasting. Mental contrasting allows you to anticipate the obstacles.
-   Then when the obstacles are encountered, you have an implementation intention plan to get
    through the obstacles.
